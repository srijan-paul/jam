## Jam

A JavaScript toolchain built from the ground up.
**Work in progress!**

Goals:

- Faster than existing tools. 
- 100% Spec complaint
- Supports JS, TS, JSX, and TSX out of the box.
- Can do data flow analysis.
- Linter extensible with JS plugins 
    (I plan to embed the [Kiesel](https://kiesel.dev) JS engine).
