# Jam

A high-performance JavaScript toolchain + analyzer built from the ground up.
**Work in progress!**

Jam is a JavaScript parser, linter, formatter, printer and vulnerability scanner.

## Goals

- Competitive in performance with existing tools. 
- Support JS, JSX, and TypeScript out of the box.
    - And the `<script>` part of VueJS code.
- Single, small binary.
- Support data flow analysis and call-graphs with an accessible API. 
- Expose a capable parsing and scope resolution, such that a bundler, minifier, etc., can be built on top of it.
- API to write lint rules with zig.
- Custom JavaScript plugins.

## Roadmap

- Phase 1:
    - [x] A fast, 100% Spec compliant JavaScript parser.
    - [x] Port [ESLint scope](https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/eslint-scope) to Zig
    - [x] JSX parsing.
    - [ ] Semantic analysis: Control Flow Graphs (**WIP**).
    - [ ] TypeScript parsing (**WIP**).
    - [ ] Runtime for a linter, with Zig plugin support.
    - [ ] Formatter with a **language agnostic backend**.
- Alpha release
    - [ ] Simple linter with all the base rules from ESLint.
    - [ ] A prototype for the jam formatter
- Beta release
    - [ ] Data flow analysis and taint checking


## Local development

I've tried to keep the development process hassle-free.
You need only a Zig compiler (and optionally an environment variable) to get going.

If you still face any issues, feel free to open an issue
or reach out to me on discord (`@injuly.`), [twitter](https://x.com/ptrCast), or [e-mail](mailto:srijan@injuly.in).
I usually respond within a day.

> **NOTE:** If you're willing to contribute, It's a good idea to copy the contents of ./pre-commit to 
your `./.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
> This will ensure you didn't break any existing functionality before letting you commit changes.

### Basic setup

1. Ensure you have a `master` build of the zig compiler –
to seamlessly switch between multiple zig versions, I recommend using [zvm](https://github.com/tristanisham/zvm).
2. Clone this project into your development machine.
3. Run `zig build run -- <path-to-file.js>` to see a parsed AST for the given file.
4. Run `zig build test` to run the unit tests.

### Checking ECMAScript conformance

To avoid regressions and keep track of spec compliance, we use a `results.json` and `babel-results.json` file –
their formats are explained in the [tools README](./tools/README.md).

You'll need to set the `JAM_TESTS_262_DIR` environment variable to the path of a cloned [tc39/test262-parser-tests](https://github.com/tc39/test262-parser-tests) repository:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tc39/test262-parser-tests.git /tmp/test262-parser-tests
# `tools/ec262-tests` can find the tests if you set the environment variable.
export JAM_TESTS_262_DIR=/tmp/test262-parser-tests
```

To compare your changes with the existing test results, run `zig build test262 -- compare ./tools/results.json`.
If it exits normally, you didn't break anything!

To update the test results when you increase conformance, run `zig build test262 > ./tools/results.json`.


Currently, the format of the `results.json` file is roughly as follows:

```js
{
  // % of test files that either: a) parsed incorrectly, or b) failed to parse.
  "fail_percent": 35.703479576399396,
  // % of test files that were parsed correctly.
  "pass_percent": 64.2965204236006,
  // number of test files that parsed but had an incorrect syntax tree.
  "unmatching_ast_count": 17,
  // results for individual test cases:
  "test_cases": {
    "2db5219f0ac5dd71.js": "parse_error",
    "c532e126a986c1d4.js": "pass",
    "d532e126a986c1d4.js": "ast_no_match",
    // ...goes on for a few thousand lines...
```
