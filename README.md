# Jam

A JavaScript toolchain built from the ground up.
**Work in progress!**

To see how we test with the [tc39/test262-parser-tests](https://github.com/tc39/test262-parser-tests),
see the [tests262 runner](./tools/README.md).

## Goals

- Faster than existing tools. 
- 100% Spec compliant 
- Supports JS, TS, JSX, TSX, and CSS3 out of the box.
- Can perform data flow analysis.
- Linter extensible with JS plugins 
    (I plan to embed the [Kiesel](https://kiesel.dev) JS engine).
