## Handwritten expression parsing tests

The tests in this directory are handwritten to verify the shape of a parse tree.
The ASTs have been manually verified by comparing the output with parsers like ESpree and Meriyah.

For every `<file>.js`, there is a corresponding `<file>.json` that contains a stringified version of the expected AST.
The test block in `src/syntax/parser.zig` will parse these files, and compare the parse tree with the expected output.
